# CaloriesCalculator App Frontend by Locagus

### Login data to test: 
`username: mehul`\
`password: mehul`

### :(

`Protected Route redirecting to the wrong path`\
`Sometimes login doesn't work for the first try. If it happens, try again and should be all right.`

## What we have in version 1.0.2

`1. Creating, removing, renameing meals by click in button`\
`2. Adding new products by finding them by input or creating own in modal`\
`3. Automatically recalculating macronutrient's values after changing amount's value`\
`4. For logged user: adding meal to favourites list`\
`5. Registation, login, logout`\
`6. Changing values of products in favourite meal by changing amount's value or changing everything's value`\
`7. Removing favourite meals`\
`8. Protected routes`\
`9. Redux global state`\
`10. Bad looking at smartphones and small screens.`

## TODO

`Improve the appearance for whole app`\
`Responsiveness`\
`Add confirm modal while removing favourite meal`\
`All fetches to one file`\
`Create admin panel`\
`Create user profil with more data`\
`Improve validations`\
`Block login and registration path for logged users.`\
`Rebuild global state into redux-toolkit`\
`Refactoring`\
`And probably more`
